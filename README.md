# Ensemble_model

input_data.xlsx: contains 169 selected data for the training and validation of the model. reflectance spectra of each sample were interpolated to a uniform range of 550–2250 nm and denoised using Gaussian filtering (σ = 7 nm). The interpolation was performed at fixed wavelength intervals of 50-nm interval. All the spectra were normalized at 550 nm. The last column indicates the irradiation type (1- olivine with H ion irradiation, 2- pyroxene with H ion irradiation, 3- olivine-pyroxene mixtures and OCs with H ion irradiation, 10- olivine with laser irradiation,11- pyroxene with laser irradiation, 12- olivine-pyroxene mixtures and OCs with laser irradiation ).
data_all_laser: includes the exposure time for the training and validation data and the details of the samples (relevant article, sample type, irradiation method, etc.).
