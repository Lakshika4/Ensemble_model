# Ensemble_model

input_data.xlsx: containes 169 selected data for the training and validation of the model. reflectance spectra of each samples were interpolated to a uniform range of 550–2250 nm and denoised using Gaussian filtering (σ = 7 nm). The interpolation was performed at fixed wavelength intervals of 50-nm interval. All the spectra were normalized at 550 nm. Last column indicate the irradiation type (1- olivine with H ion irradiation, 2- pyroxene with H ion irradiation, 3- olivine-pyroxene mixtuers and OCs with H ion irradiation, 10- olivine with laser irradiation ,11- pyroxene with laser irradiation, 12- olivine-pyroxene mixtuers and OCs with laser irradiation )
